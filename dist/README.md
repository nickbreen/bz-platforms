Here we define the concept of a Linux distribution.

We define a [constraint_setting](https://bazel.build/reference/be/platform#constraint_setting) and several [constraint_values](https://bazel.build/reference/be/platform#constraint_value).

In this case we define `debian`, `ubuntu`, and `fedora`.

These are the constraints we will use to differentiate our various (target and execution) platforms.
